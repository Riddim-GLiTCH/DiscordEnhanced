/*
--IMPORTANT NOTE--
This theme consists entirely of snippets made by other people.
I can not take credit for their work, all I did was compile them into a theme.
Credits to all the snippet creators can be found in the source files.

This theme should be compatible with simple recolors, tested with Discord Colorways and Amoled-cord.
Though, it may not be flawless. So no promises.

Thanks to all the snippet creators and the BD community for the snippets, and helping to fix some of them.
Enjoy the theme!
